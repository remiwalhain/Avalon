# Welcome to the board game Avalon (The Resistance).
This is an adapted version of the game designed to be played on a single device. 
The goal is to recreate the feel of the original board game, encouraging in-person interaction with everyone gathered in the same room, rather than isolated on individual screens.

To launch the game [click here](https://remiwalhain.github.io/Avalon/).
The rules can be found on the game launch page.
